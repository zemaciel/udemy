### Cookie Banner
1. Use a Cookie Banner Library or Tool
There are several prebuilt tools and libraries that make it easy to add a cookie banner compliant with GDPR. Some popular ones include:

CookieYes https://www.cookieyes.com/
Cookiebot https://www.cookiebot.com/
Osano https://www.osano.com/
These tools provide plug-and-play solutions with customizable designs, cookie scanning, and automatic policy generation.

3. Add a Privacy Policy Page
Ensure your site has a Privacy Policy page (privacy-policy.html) that explains:

What data you collect.
Why you collect it.
How you use cookies.
User rights (e.g., opt-out, data deletion requests).
4. Test Compliance
Verify that the banner only appears if no consent has been given.
Ensure analytics/tracking scripts are loaded only after user consent.
Check your implementation using GDPR compliance tools like CookieMetrix [https://cookiemetrix.com/] or GDPR Checker [https://gdpr.eu/].
