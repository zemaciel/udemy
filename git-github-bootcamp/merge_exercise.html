    <h1>Git Merging Exercise</h1>

    <h2>Git Merging Exercise</h2>

    <p>This exercise is a little bit different. Rather than following my exact instructions step by step, I'd like for
        you to come up with your own scenarios that meet my requirements. Start by creating a new repo. Make a file or
        two in the repo for you to work on. If you need some inspiration...I'll be working in a file called
        `greetings.txt` It will contain greetings in different languages.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 1: Fast Forward Merge</h2>

    <p>Your goal is to generate a fast forward merge. Demonstrate that you understand how FF merges work by
        creating one on your own!

        Make a new branch. Do some work in the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results
        in a fast forward merge. Merge that branch into master and see if you were right!
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2: Merge Commit (No Conflicts)</h2>
    <p>
        Your goal is to generate a merge commit with NO MERGE CONFLICTS.

        Create a new branch. Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it
        results
        in a merge commit. The merge should not result in any conflicts. Merge that branch into master and see if
        you were
        right!
    </p>

    <h2>Part 3: Conflicts!</h2>
    <p>
        Your goal is to generate merge a conflict!
        Create a new branch. Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into the master
        branch, it results in a merge conflict. Merge that branch into master and see if you were right! Resolve the
        conflict!
    </p>
